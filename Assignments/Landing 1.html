<h3 align="center" id="aboutus"> ABOUTUS </h3>
<p>ITS OUR KIDS!
Great schools cannot exist without great groups of kids, and the diversity of those kids is what many principals say makes their schools so great.

Lolli Haws is principal at Oakridge Elementary School in Arlington, Virginia. Diversity is a given in a school whose location is so close to Washington, D.C. Seventy percent of Oakridges 460 students are from countries other than the United States, and 90 percent were born outside Virginia. We have the most beautiful, interesting, interested, and talented children from all over the world," Haws told Education World. They are truly here to learn, grow, and experience life in the Washington D.C., United States of America."

Every adult and child is enriched by just being part of our school," added Haws. Every child and every teacher has the special privilege of meeting, talking to, learning with, and playing with children and families from places in the world most only see in an atlas or hear on the news.

We are an international school that lives and learns together in our own world of Oakridge like the rest of the world should live -- with joy, understanding, and delight in what each of us offers each other."

Principal Karen Mink expresses similar sentiments about the students of the Allen School in Aurora, Illinois. The schools demographic is 59 percent Hispanic, 22 percent Black, 16 percent White, and smaller percentages of Asians and Eastern Europeans.

Our school is a perfect example of how different people can live together, work together, and learn together," said Mink. The Allen School community respects each other, supports each other, and helps each other to succeed."

A VERY SPECIAL CLIMATE
The climate of a school includes its kids and its diversity, but it includes much more than that. According to Carol Robertson, a positive and nurturing climate is the greatest thing about her school, Lewis Vincent Elementary School in Kurnool,A.P </p>

<P><b>Boarding Facilities</b>
The school provides residential facilities for both the boys and girls on campus. All the hostels are well maintained and have all the facilities that help the children live and grow in an environment that they can identify as their home. Trained staff members, including a housemistress and a housemaster, along with a whole range of support staff, are entrusted with the well-being of the children and to ensure that the needs of pupils are fully met. The food we provide is most hygienic and nutritious. The school places much emphasis on the importance of students taking responsibility for themselves, and for each other, within a very carefully supervised framework. For our boarders, the hostel is also home and as such provides every facility for study, leisure and a flourishing sense of community, wich can add so much to school days and later life.</P>

<p><b>Good Health</b>
Seeds of health consciousness are sowed at a tender age with a hope that the concept of good health through healthy food and physical exercise will continue lifelong.
A carefully planned menu, facilities for all kinds of games and sports including Yoga / Meditation classes, lectures by stalwarts from the medical field are some of the steps we have taken towards building the foundation of good health.</p>
